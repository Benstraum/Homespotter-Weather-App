# Background to the app
This App is my solution to a code challenge to create a weather application targetting a weather API.  It allows users to input a location and it will provide a three-day forecast with information about the location specified. I spent approximately 8 hours, as requested, the max time to spend on the project. I took inspiration from google for the styling, which I created using pure CSS. 

# USE
Users can input any of the following into the search and it will provide a forecast for their area:
city name,
US zip,
UK postcode,
Canada postal code,
metar:<metar code>,
iata:<3 digit airport code>,
IP address.

# Technologies Used
React/Redux, node.js, express.js, Axios, and CSS. 

# Further Development
Given I had to be mindful of time during this project (8 hours). I will come back to implement user-determined forecast length, graphs for temp/precipitation/wind speed over 24 hours. Ability to click and change the focal viewing of the current day. Finally, some automated testing to ensure the API and my functions are working as intended.
