# Background to the app
This App is my solution to a code challenge to create a weather application targetting a weather API.  It allows users to input a location and it will provide a three-day forecast with information about the location specified. I spent approximately 8 hours, as requested, the max time to spend on the project. I took inspiration from google for the styling, which I created using pure CSS. 

# Technologies Used
React/Redux, node.js, express.js, Axios, and CSS.
